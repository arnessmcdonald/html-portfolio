<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have worked in logistics for over 15 years and decided to make a career change. I though long and hard and wanted to move into IT. I first considered cyber security and got my security + certification. But with this certification I first ended up with a help desk job.</p>

<p>Long story short I worked there for a few months and wanted out as soon as I could work somewhere else. And not for reasons you would think. For my first 3 months I got paid to watch other people do work for the majority of my day... That's it... This drove me insane so I decided to look as hard as I knew how to find anything besides what I was doing.</p>

<p>As I was looking another company looked at my resume and somehow knew I would be a good fit for the job based on my experience listed on my resume. To shorten up this story quite a bit, I absolutely love the work I do. I also love the people I work with and the client we are serving. I get to work around some of the smartest people I've ever met and I'm hoping to be able to learn a lot from them.</p>
