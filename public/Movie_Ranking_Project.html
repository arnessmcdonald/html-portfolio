<h1>The Best Moview According to Ken</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Interstellar</h3>

<p>This movie is one of the most mind bending, beautiful, and thrilling movie I've seen. Though the movie is long, the content is actually very exciting and has you wondering what is going to happen next. What is also interesting is that the way the director tells the story, it almost seems that what is happening in the movie seem plausible!!</p>

<h3>A Quiet Place</h3>

<p>This movie in some ways similar to Interstallar in that it is extremely realistic besides the ailien life form that has coexisted with humans for a while at time the movie takes place. Just like Interstellar, it tells the story in a fashion where something like this movie is plausible in the future.</p>

<h3>World War Z</h3>

<p>In my opinion one of the best modern zombie moview put together. It's action packed and has a compelling orgin story of the virus. If you love apocalyptic movies and have never seen this one in particular, this one is a must.</p>
